- Card-based layout with rounded corners and soft shadows for a digital-first, user-friendly feel.
- Use micro-animations for wallet progress bars filling and pie charts expanding to provide visual feedback and enhance user engagement.
- Crisp and modern icon set, with consistent line weights and filled styles to match the overall disciplined and digital aesthetic.
